# AHMP

AH-SMP is a fork of AHMP that aims to make the mod better for singleplayer

## Philosophy

- The AI and player should always be able to one up the other
- No one should be able to spam to win
- Historical accuracy must be included in a way that makes gameplay fun

## How to play?

Some of the stuff from AHMP is carried over, but gameplay will be more vanilla like.

### Do's and don't's!

- **DO NOT** tax 100% or tariff 100%, you will face the consequences if you have a weak economy (rebels mainly)
- **DO NOT** max spend on education and admin, unless you can afford to
- **DO NOT** declare war without checking alliance blocs first
- **DO NOT** spam units of "lower quality" to win - regiments are more of "quality" over "quantity" (for unit types), do not spam irregulars or you will lose all your soldier pops!
- **DO NOT** go to war without a strong economy and some reserve cash
- **DO NOT** spam building industries, you will go bankrupt immeadiately
- **DO NOT** spend money in events, or you will go bankrupt if you can't afford it
- **DO NOT** get into debt if you don't know how to use it - otherwise you'll go bankrupt

- **DO** use domestic slider as high as you can if you're laissez faire
- **DO** get strong allies if you're a secondary power, especially great powers
- **DO** colonize africa IF you can afford it (war is costly!)

### Extra notes when playing
- AI will always **try to** go for the historical path unless there is player intervention
- Africa severely lacks flavour, so if you want more Africa flavour *just ask for it*
- Substates gameplay boils down to civilizing, and either becoming independent or submitting (instant game over)

## Changes
