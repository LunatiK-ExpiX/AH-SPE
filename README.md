# AHMP

AHMP is a fork of HPM catered for Multiplayer & Project Alice.

## Philosophy

- If the AI can do it, so can the player
- And if the player can do it, so can the AI
- There is no wrong option

## Changes

- War exhaustion has been reduced considerably, but it can start to add up if you are at war for a long period of time (+3 years)
- Casualties now are extremely devastating for your POPs, so you should take care of your armies
- Technologies are all researchable day 1
- Emigration/Immigration to the new world is now natural instead of being forced
- Made national focuses even more powerful, especially party loyalty ones
- Generals and Admirals are now considerably rarer, and die faster; they however amass more prestige
- You're able to mobilize way more if you're jingoist or pro-military
- Dreadnoughts, Ironclads and Cruisers are massively buffed so they make it very stupid to send Man 'o Wars against them
- Same with Armors with Infantry
- Regiments minimum size is 100 and 1,000 (max)
- Understaffed regiments, basically you don't magically spawn soldiers, the number of soldiers on the brigades actually correspond 1:1 to a POP
- Wartime soldier promotion increased
- Sikhim, Nepal and Bhutan become puppets of Britain
- Sokoto has puppets on sorrounding african nations, for "somewhat historical" and balance purpouses
- Release vassal decisions removed, because Alice can already release vassals w/o decisions
- More research points allowed to be stored
- Less conservative UH changes when doing reforms
- Speed up research
