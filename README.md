# AHMP

AHMP is a fork of HPM catered for Multiplayer & Project Alice.

## Philosophy

- If the AI can do it, so can the player
- And if the player can do it, so can the AI
- There is no wrong option
- No railroading, use "natural" game mechanics instead of forcing it

## How to play?

Since the game is heavily rebalanced, forget what you learnt from vanilla - it's going to be harmful:

### Do's and don't's!

- **DO NOT** tax 100% or tariff 100%, you will face the consequences if you have a weak economy (rebels mainly)
- **DO NOT** max spend on education and admin, unless you can afford to
- **DO NOT** declare war without checking alliance blocs first
- **DO NOT** spam units of "lower quality" to win - regiments are more of "quality" over "quantity" (for unit types), do not spam irregulars or you will lose all your soldier pops!
- **DO NOT** go to war without a strong economy and some reserve cash
- **DO NOT** spam building industries, you will go bankrupt immeadiately
- **DO NOT** spend money in events, or you will go bankrupt if you can't afford it
- **DO NOT** get into debt if you don't know how to use it - otherwise you'll go bankrupt

- **DO** use domestic slider as high as you can if you're laissez faire
- **DO** get strong allies if you're a secondary power, especially great powers
- **DO** colonize africa IF you can afford it (war is costly!)

### Extra notes when playing
- AI will always **try to** go for the historical path unless there is player intervention
- Africa severely lacks flavour, so if you want more Africa flavour *just ask for it*
- Substates gameplay boils down to civilizing, and either becoming independent or submitting (instant game over)

## Changes

- New substate mechanics! At the start of the game various nations will be split in substates, fear not, once they develop enough and have high enough administration, they will be integrated peacefully!
- War exhaustion has been reduced considerably, but it can start to add up if you are at war for a long period of time (+3 years)
- Casualties now are extremely devastating for your POPs, so you should take care of your armies
- Technologies are all researchable day 1
- Emigration/Immigration to the new world is now natural instead of being forced
- Made national focuses even more powerful, especially party loyalty ones
- Generals and Admirals are now considerably rarer, and die faster; they however amass more prestige
- You're able to mobilize way more if you're jingoist or pro-military
- Dreadnoughts, Ironclads and Cruisers are massively buffed so they make it very stupid to send Man 'o Wars against them
- Same with Armors with Infantry
- Regiments minimum size is 100 and 1,000 (max)
- Understaffed regiments, basically you don't magically spawn soldiers, the number of soldiers on the brigades actually correspond 1:1 to a POP
- Wartime soldier promotion increased
- Sikhim, Nepal and Bhutan become puppets of Britain
- Sokoto has puppets on sorrounding african nations, for "somewhat historical" and balance purpouses
- Release vassal decisions removed, because Alice can already release vassals w/o decisions
- More research points allowed to be stored
- Less conservative UH changes when doing reforms
- Speed up research
