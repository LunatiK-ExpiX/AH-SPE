EVTNAME23212;Comet Sighted
EVTDESC23212;A Comet was sighted in the sky, some believe that this portends fell times ahead. Others believe that they are in fact pixie fairies floating in the sky. There are also those who believe that this comet is most probably a giant ball of ice floating through the sky and the long tail is created due to the energy of the sun. The arguments amongst the three equally viable theories is stimulating the pursuit of knowledge in our country.;
EVTOPTA23212;Thank God we live in such enlightened times;
EVTOPTB23212;Keep looking at the sky!
EVTOPTC23212;A colonized comet would make a fine satellite!
EVTOPTD23212;A magnificient opportunity to fund an astronomy program
EVTOPTE23212;Interesting... anything else?
EVTNAME23215;Uncontrolled vassals
EVTDESC23215;$COUNTRY$ is, unfortunely, divided into substates, this is due to the low control we have over those areas with respect to other areas of $COUNTRY$. We are able to integrate them once we get enough $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people living there. Another option is to release those states and declare war against them to annex them, but they will prove to be a hinderance due to low literacy and low militancy, and we already have $POP$ people to take care of.
EVTOPTA23215;Unfortunate
EVTNAME23216;Formal integration
EVTDESC23216;$COUNTRY$ has succeed in organizing itself, attaining self-sufficiency and autonomy. But now our overlord is asking to formally integrate us... as a state, $MONARCHTITLE$ what should we do?
EVTOPTA23216;We will peacefuly integrate
EVTOPTB23216;We ask for limited autonomy
EVTOPTC23216;We will fight!
EVTNAME23217;Vassalize $FROMCOUNTRY$?
EVTDESC23217;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats arrived at $CAPITAL$ to come into negotiations with $COUNTRY_ADJ$ representatives of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government, $CAPITAL$ feelings towards giving autonomy to $FROMCOUNTRY$ are mixed, some of our most fervent nationalist advisors are strongly against it, however, if we do allow autonomous regions we will surely be seen as weak...
EVTOPTA23217;$FROMCOUNTRY$ is our $COUNTRY_ADJ$ land
EVTOPTB23217;$FROMCOUNTRY$ is their $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ land
EVTNAME98655;The conference of $CAPITAL$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98655;After much discussion and deliberation, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people are now eager to form a confederation with the rest of the cultures in our empires, ceasing nationalist agitations by covering everyone under the same umbrella!
EVT98655OPTA;For the shared mutual interests!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98656;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Confederation project;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98656;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats arrived at $CAPITAL$ with a zany proposal: A united confederation for all of the danubian region. This is honestly baffling, however, given our weak positions as disnuted nations, uniting all of us under the same banner will prove to be extremely useful.
EVT98656OPTA;We agree;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT98656OPTB;We'll keep an eye out;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT98656OPTC;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ scum!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98657;$FROMCOUNTRY$ agrees
EVTDESC98657;We have secured the vote of $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$, they've talked with our diplomats about the causes and effects of our proposal, evaluated the ramifications and implications of uniting all of us into a single federation, and ultimately, decided that $COUNTRY$ requires a response, and here it be!
EVT98657OPTA;Splendid
EVTNAME98658;$FROMCOUNTRY$ abstains
EVTDESC98658;We have secured the vote of $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$, they've talked with our diplomats about the causes and effects of our proposal, evaluated the ramifications and implications of uniting all of us into a single federation, and ultimately, decided that $COUNTRY$ requires a response, and here it be!
EVT98658OPTA;We'll see
EVTNAME98659;$FROMCOUNTRY$ refuses
EVTDESC98659;We have secured the vote of $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$, they've talked with our diplomats about the causes and effects of our proposal, evaluated the ramifications and implications of uniting all of us into a single federation, and ultimately, decided that $COUNTRY$ requires a response, and here it be!
EVT98659OPTA;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ scum!
EVTNAME98660;Successful conference of $CAPITAL$ 
EVTDESC98660;Success! After several talks with various diplomats, a majority vote determined that we should form the confederation! This is a grand moment for all of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people, $YEAR$ will be known as the year of the $CAPITAL$ conference!
EVT98660OPTA;Let there be peace!
EVTNAME98661;Failed conference of $CAPITAL$ 
EVTDESC98661;Many tough talks with diplomats around $COUNTRY$ and yet we struck no deals, no concessions or negotiations that favored them, we were in a terrible position, and we didn't only look like a baffoon, we also inspired heavy nationalistic sentiments across our nation, we should be careful of what type of proposals we do next time...
EVT98661OPTA;Oh dear
EVT98661OPTB;They better join our new federation
