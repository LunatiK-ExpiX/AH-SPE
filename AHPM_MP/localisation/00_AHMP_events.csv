EVTNAME23212;Comet Sighted
EVTDESC23212;A Comet was sighted in the sky, some believe that this portends fell times ahead. Others believe that they are in fact pixie fairies floating in the sky. There are also those who believe that this comet is most probably a giant ball of ice floating through the sky and the long tail is created due to the energy of the sun. The arguments amongst the three equally viable theories is stimulating the pursuit of knowledge in our country.;
