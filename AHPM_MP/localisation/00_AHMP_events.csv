EVTNAME23212;Comet Sighted
EVTDESC23212;A Comet was sighted in the sky, some believe that this portends fell times ahead. Others believe that they are in fact pixie fairies floating in the sky. There are also those who believe that this comet is most probably a giant ball of ice floating through the sky and the long tail is created due to the energy of the sun. The arguments amongst the three equally viable theories is stimulating the pursuit of knowledge in our country.;
EVTOPTA23212;Thank God we live in such enlightened times;
EVTOPTB23212;Keep looking at the sky!
EVTOPTC23212;A colonized comet would make a fine satellite!
EVTOPTD23212;A magnificient opportunity to fund an astronomy program
EVTOPTE23212;Interesting... anything else?
EVTNAME23215;Uncontrolled vassals
EVTDESC23215;$COUNTRY$ is, unfortunely, divided into substates, this is due to the low control we have over those areas with respect to other areas of $COUNTRY$. We are able to integrate them once we get enough $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people living there. Another option is to release those states and declare war against them to annex them, but they will prove to be a hinderance due to low literacy and low militancy, and we already have $POP$ people to take care of.
EVTOPTA23215;Unfortunate
EVTNAME23216;Formal integration
EVTDESC23216;$COUNTRY$ has succeed in organizing itself, attaining self-sufficiency and autonomy. But now our overlord is asking to formally integrate us... as a state, $MONARCHTITLE$ what should we do?
EVTOPTA23216;We will peacefuly integrate
EVTOPTB23216;We ask for limited autonomy
EVTOPTC23216;We will fight!
EVTNAME23217;Vassalize $FROMCOUNTRY$?
EVTDESC23217;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats arrived at $CAPITAL$ to come into negotiations with $COUNTRY_ADJ$ representatives of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government, $CAPITAL$ feelings towards giving autonomy to $FROMCOUNTRY$ are mixed, some of our most fervent nationalist advisors are strongly against it, however, if we do allow autonomous regions we will surely be seen as weak...
EVTOPTA23217;$FROMCOUNTRY$ is our $COUNTRY_ADJ$ land
EVTOPTB23217;$FROMCOUNTRY$ is their $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ land
