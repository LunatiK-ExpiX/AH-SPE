EVTNAME23212;Comet Sighted
EVTDESC23212;A Comet was sighted in the sky, some believe that this portends fell times ahead. Others believe that they are in fact pixie fairies floating in the sky. There are also those who believe that this comet is most probably a giant ball of ice floating through the sky and the long tail is created due to the energy of the sun. The arguments amongst the three equally viable theories is stimulating the pursuit of knowledge in our country.;
EVTOPTA23212;Thank God we live in such enlightened times;
EVTOPTB23212;Keep looking at the sky!
EVTOPTC23212;A colonized comet would make a fine satellite!
EVTOPTD23212;A magnificient opportunity to fund an astronomy program
EVTOPTE23212;Interesting... anything else?
EVTNAME23215;Uncontrolled vassals
EVTDESC23215;$COUNTRY$ is, unfortunely, divided into substates, this is due to the low control we have over those areas with respect to other areas of $COUNTRY$. We are able to integrate them once we get enough $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people living there. Another option is to release those states and declare war against them to annex them, but they will prove to be a hinderance due to low literacy and low militancy, and we already have $POP$ people to take care of.
EVTOPTA23215;Unfortunate
EVTNAME23216;Formal integration
EVTDESC23216;$COUNTRY$ has succeed in organizing itself, attaining self-sufficiency and autonomy. But now our overlord is asking to formally integrate us... as a state, $MONARCHTITLE$ what should we do?
EVTOPTA23216;We will peacefuly integrate
EVTOPTB23216;We ask for limited autonomy
EVTOPTC23216;We will fight!
EVTNAME23217;Vassalize $FROMCOUNTRY$?
EVTDESC23217;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats arrived at $CAPITAL$ to come into negotiations with $COUNTRY_ADJ$ representatives of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government, $CAPITAL$ feelings towards giving autonomy to $FROMCOUNTRY$ are mixed, some of our most fervent nationalist advisors are strongly against it, however, if we do allow autonomous regions we will surely be seen as weak...
EVTOPTA23217;$FROMCOUNTRY$ is our $COUNTRY_ADJ$ land
EVTOPTB23217;$FROMCOUNTRY$ is their $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ land
EVTNAME98655;The conference of $CAPITAL$;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98655;After much discussion and deliberation, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people are now eager to form a confederation with the rest of the cultures in our empires, ceasing nationalist agitations by covering everyone under the same umbrella!
EVT98655OPTA;For the shared mutual interests!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98656;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Confederation project;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTDESC98656;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats arrived at $CAPITAL$ with a zany proposal: A united confederation for all of the danubian region. This is honestly baffling, however, given our weak positions as disnuted nations, uniting all of us under the same banner will prove to be extremely useful.
EVT98656OPTA;We agree;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT98656OPTB;We'll keep an eye out;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVT98656OPTC;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ scum!;;;;;;;;;;;;;
EVTNAME98657;$FROMCOUNTRY$ agrees
EVTDESC98657;We have secured the vote of $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$, they've talked with our diplomats about the causes and effects of our proposal, evaluated the ramifications and implications of uniting all of us into a single federation, and ultimately, decided that $COUNTRY$ requires a response, and here it be!
EVT98657OPTA;Splendid
EVTNAME98658;$FROMCOUNTRY$ abstains
EVTDESC98658;We have secured the vote of $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$, they've talked with our diplomats about the causes and effects of our proposal, evaluated the ramifications and implications of uniting all of us into a single federation, and ultimately, decided that $COUNTRY$ requires a response, and here it be!
EVT98658OPTA;We'll see
EVTNAME98659;$FROMCOUNTRY$ refuses
EVTDESC98659;We have secured the vote of $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$, they've talked with our diplomats about the causes and effects of our proposal, evaluated the ramifications and implications of uniting all of us into a single federation, and ultimately, decided that $COUNTRY$ requires a response, and here it be!
EVT98659OPTA;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ scum!
EVTNAME98660;Successful conference of $CAPITAL$ 
EVTDESC98660;Success! After several talks with various diplomats, a majority vote determined that we should form the confederation! This is a grand moment for all of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people, $YEAR$ will be known as the year of the $CAPITAL$ conference!
EVT98660OPTA;Let there be peace!
EVTNAME98661;Failed conference of $CAPITAL$ 
EVTDESC98661;Many tough talks with diplomats around $COUNTRY$ and yet we struck no deals, no concessions or negotiations that favored them, we were in a terrible position, and we didn't only look like a baffoon, we also inspired heavy nationalistic sentiments across our nation, we should be careful of what type of proposals we do next time...
EVT98661OPTA;Oh dear
EVT98661OPTB;They better join our new federation
EVTNAME31504;Natshertanye;
EVTDESC31504;The Serb Ilya Garashanin demanded in his writing 'Natshertanye' the unity of all southern Slavs in the struggle against their $COUNTRY_ADJ$ oppressors. His writings became the programme for the southern Slav nationalist movement.
EVTOPTA31504;He has a point;
EVTOPTB31504;Slavs are $COUNTRY_ADJ$;
EVTNAME31505;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Empress Sisi;
EVTDESC31505;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Princess Elisabeth, called Sisi, married the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ $MONARCHTITLE$ Franz Joseph I in $YEAR$. Her unconventional ways, often in total disregard for etiquette, endeared her to her people.
EVTOPTA31505;Vivat!
EVTOPTB31505;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ scum
EVTOPTC31505;She's a threat
EVTNAME31542;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Princess Sisi marriage?
EVTDESC31542;Franz Joseph I is offering marriage to our princess Sisi, this could strenghten their relations with $COUNTRY$, but it will subject us to foreign rule.
EVTOPTA31542;Yay
EVTOPTB31542;Nay
EVTNAME31506;Toward a New Theatre;
EVTDESC31506;After the brilliant $COUNTRY_ADJ$ designer Joseph Urban began working at the Boston Opera Company, design in the American theatre took on a decidedly continental approach, becoming a more dynamic, colorful, and exciting experience.;
EVTOPTA31506;An artistic genius
EVTOPTB31506;A menace to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ society
EVTOPTC31506;Theatre? Ugh... spare me of boredom!
EVTNAME13350;An Elephant for $COUNTRY$?
EVTDESC13350;On this account we desire to procure and send elephants to be let loose in and increase and multiply in the continent of $COUNTRY$'. In $YEAR$ King Rama IV, also known as King Mongkut, the fourth $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ monarch of the house of Chakri, expressed in a letter to president James Buchanan of $COUNTRY$, upon having heard from an $COUNTRY_ADJ$ captain visiting $FROMCOUNTRY$ that there were no elephants in $CONTINENTNAME$, his desire to gift one to $COUNTRY$. The letter did not arrive in $COUNTRY$ until the Buchanan administration had left office, and was instead received by president Abraham Lincoln who, as the story goes, politely declined the offer, pointing out that the elephants might not take to well to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ climate.
EVTOPTA13350;Such a generous gift we can't reject!
EVTOPTB13350;But it was very kind of him to offer!
EVTOPTC13350;A what now? Oh bloody hell!
EVTNAME13150;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ foreigners harassed
EVTDESC13150;The high militancy among certain parts of the population in $PROVINCENAME$ has lead to an outbreak of violence directed at local $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ expatriate foreigners. The embassies of $FROMCOUNTRY$ have all lodged formal diplomatic complaints with $COUNTRY$, and seem to expect some sort of action on our part. What should the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people do?;
EVTOPTA13150;Ignore them
EVTOPTB13150;Round up the usual suspects
EVTNAME13151;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ harrassed in uncivilized land
EVTDESC13151;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ tourists want to see some uncivilized existing in their natural habitat, however they went at $COUNTRY$ to protect them from harrassment by locals
EVTOPTA13151;Uncivilized barbarians!
EVTNAME36937;The Name of the Royal House
EVTDESC36937;The German origins of our royal house have become an issue for some of our subjects in this time of war with the Germans. Some have even questioned the royal family's loyalty to $COUNTRY$. It has been suggested we domesticate the name of the royal family to show the crown's total devotion to $COUNTRY$.
EVTOPTA36937;The House of Windsor, long may it reign
EVTOPTB36937;We must keep our royalty intact
EVTOPTC36937;That would violate the constitution
EVTNAME23400;Membership in the International Olympic Committee
EVTDESC23400;The combination of renewed interest in Ancient Greek civilization and the idea of sport as an important part of social development has led a French aristocrat, Baron Pierre de Coubertin, to propose reviving the Olympic Games as a way to promote international peace through friendly athletic competition between nations. Should $COUNTRY$ join his International Olympic Committee to organize the future olympic games?
EVTOPTA23400;An excellent idea! We accept.
EVTOPTB23400;The idea is interesting, but not at this time.
EVTNAME23401;Shall $COUNTRY$ host the Olympic Games?
EVTDESC23401;The International Olympic Committee has invited our government to organize the Olympic Games. Should we accept the offer?
EVTOPTA23401;Yes, it is an excellent opportunity to show $COUNTRY_ADJ$ progress
EVTOPTB23401;No, we have better uses of our nation's limited resources
EVTDESC23402;The International Olympic Committee has decided to offer $COUNTRY$ the responsibility to organize the olympic games of this year. Should we accept the offer?
EVTNAME23403;Attend The Olympic Games in $FROMCOUNTRY$?
EVTDESC23403;With the announcement of $FROMCOUNTR$ as the host nation, the International Olympic Committee has sent invitations to its members to attend the games, including $COUNTRY$. Shall we attend?
EVTOPTA23403;Yes we will attend
EVTOPTB23403;We unfortunately can not attend
EVTNAME23404;The Olympic Games
EVTDESC23404;Athletes from around the world have travelled from various places in the world to arrive in $CONTINENTNAME$, many tourists and visitors also came for the inauguration of the Olympic Games in $CAPITAL$; the teams came with the objective to compete as fiercely as they always do, may $COUNTRY$ be known as the host of the Olympic Games of $YEAR$. This is a great moment for $COUNTRY$ to shine on the world stage, let it be known that $CAPITAL$ has been the place where the most talented athletes came and demostrated their skills to the world to see.
EVTOPTA23404;Splendid display! May the next games be as wonderful!
EVTNAME23405;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ athletes are victorious!
EVTDESC23405;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ athletes who competed at the recent Olympic Games have been victorious and returned to $COUNTRY$ with medals of gold, silver and bronze

EVTOPTE23405;Splendid... got anything else?
EVTNAME23406;Harrassment of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ team
EVTDESC23406;After a tough encounter between $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ radicals, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ team was insulted and mocked within their stay in $FROMCOUNTRY$... our domestic politicians demand an apology from the organizers..
EVTOPTA23406;Not worth our time
EVTOPTB23406;$FROMCOUNTRY$ broke their compromise to keep our team safe
EVTOPTC23406;How dare they!? We should teach them a lesson
EVTNAME35000;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Monarchy Splits From the House of $COUNTRY$
EVTDESC35000;With the current war pitting $FROMCOUNTRY$ against a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ state, our $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ cousins decided to repudiate us to save their own reputation! They are now known as the House of Windsor, and all family ties with our Duke and his family have now been severed.
EVTOPTA35000;Blood is not thicker than water
EVTOPTB35000;They're fearful of us
