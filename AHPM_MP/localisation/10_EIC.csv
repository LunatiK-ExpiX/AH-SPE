mughal_declaration_eic_title;Declare a Jihad Against the British;;;;;;;;;;;;;
mughal_declaration_eic_desc;Unrest dominates the territory of the former Mughal Empire, now controlled by the British. There are calls for jihad by Muslim leaders like Maulana Fazl-e-Haq Khairabadi and the millenarian Ahmedullah Shah, which were taken up by Muslims, particularly artisans, which caused the British to think that the Muslims were the main force behind this unrest. The Mughal emperor, Bahadur Shah, resisted these calls for jihad because, it has been suggested, he feared outbreaks of communal violence. By abiding to these calls, expelling the British from Delhi and declaring a Jihad, by shaking off the British influence and dominance, the Shah can be acclaimed Emperor of India, his rightful title.;;;;;;;;;;;;;
